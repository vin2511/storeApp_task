3. You are an antique shop owner. An archaeologist brings you a very old Egyptian gold coin. It has a feather
   symbol and marking of 49BC on one side, and the Pharaoh symbol on the other side. The archaeologist
   told you that these coins were recovered when Roman Empire claimed Egypt in 30BC; and this is one of
   the 45 available coins of this type at the moment.
   How would you value this ancient currency?

Ans: As an antique shop owner, I would value the ancient Egyptian gold coin based on several factors such as its rarity, historical     significance, and condition.

   In this case, the coin is quite rare, with only 45 of its type available at the moment. It also has historical significance as it    dates back to 49 BC and was recovered from the time when the Roman Empire claimed Egypt in 30 BC. Additionally, the coin's design,    featuring the Pharaoh symbol and a feather symbol, could make it more valuable to collectors.

   However, the coin's condition will also be an important factor in determining its value. If it's in good condition with minimal    wear and tear, it could be worth more than if it's heavily damaged or worn down.

   To determine a specific value for the coin, I would consult with experts in ancient currency and historical artifacts. I would also    consider recent sales of similar coins at auction or through private collectors. Based on this research, I would provide the    archaeologist with an estimated value for the coin.
